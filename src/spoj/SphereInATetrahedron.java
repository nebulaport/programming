 * @ClassName SphereInATetrahedron
 * @Description TODO:Sphere in a tetrahedron
 * Of course a Sphere Online Judge System is bound to have some tasks about spheres.
 * So here is one.
 * Given the lengths of the edges of a tetrahedron
 * calculate the radius of a sphere inscribed in that * tetrahedron
 * (i.e. a sphere tangent to all t he faces).
 *
 * Input
 * Number N of test cases in a single line.
 * ( N <= 30 ) Each of the next N lines consists of 6 integer numbers -- the lengths of the edges of a tetrahedron separated by single spaces.
 * The edges are not longer than 1000 and for the tetrahedron WXYZ,
 * the order of the edges is: WX, WY, WZ, XY, XZ, YZ.
 *
 * Output
 * N lines, each consisting of a real number given with four digits decimal precision equal to the radius of a sphere inscribed in the given tetrahedron.
